# Abstract
In the poultry industry, the meat market requires a careful coordination of the broiler chicken supply chain comprised of breeders, hatcheries, farms, slaughterhouses, wholesale, and retail vendors.   Aside  from  the  inherent  challenges  of  coordinating  a  supply  chain, animal  husbandry systems face additional complex tasks.  The lack of integrated decisions within the poultry chain could lead to a production plan that: (i) does not comply with the biosecurity standards  required  in  meat  production  for  human  consumption  at  the  farms;  (ii)  violates the production and inventory capacities at the slaughterhouses and; (iv) does not meet the demand of customers.  To streamline the supply chain, we propose two modeling approaches. First,  a  mixed-integer  linear  programming  model  that  supports  production  planning  and scheduling decisions in broiler chicken production facilities.  In addition, we embedded the MILP model in a rolling-horizon scheme to improve scalability and to avoid the myopic effect of time-indexed optimization models that put too much emphasis in a specific time period. Second, a two-stage stochastic model that supports lot sizing for farms and slaughterhouses considering uncertainty in the growth of chickens.  We present the results of a case study in a poultry company in Santa Marta (Colombia) where we reach profit improvements with the MILP approach that range from 7% to 57% with a reduction in inventory costs that range from 30% to 60%, while simultaneously meeting stringent technical, tactical, and biosecurity constraints.   Finally,  the  two-stage  stochastic  model  achieves  a  reduction  of  about  5%  of costs and suggest an order policy for every growth scenario considered.
