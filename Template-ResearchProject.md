## Description of the project
The school of management and COPA research group joined forces to make a first approach on integrating the circular economy paradigm on sustainable agribusiness models. So, in 2020 we started researching about how to evaluate circular economy alternatives in agri-food system. Our main result was the consolidation of a transdisciplinary methodology that includes material flow analysis, circular economy alternatives identification and prioritization and simulation of cost-benefit scenarios.
In this research, and with the help of the cocoa farmer community, we discovered that there were improving points for the simulation model. So, in 2021, we worked on improving the prediction of yearly cocoa productivity considering climate conditions, soil type in farms and specific local crop features. We are currently also improving the prediction of cocoa prices, to improve the cost-benefit analysis and to include  life cycle costing. With these, we aim for a technology to support decisions at farm that shows productivity metrics, CO2 footprint, cash flow metrics, life cycle costing and a prescription of acircular economy alternative mix. Now I will extend the first two works
